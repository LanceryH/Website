            <h2>Who am I ?</h2>
            <p>I am passionate about aerospace engineering and dedicated to solving challenges in propulsion and space mechanics.</p>
            <p>My journey started 10 years ago when I discovered my love for space. I started reading and watching anything I could in my range of the understandable.</p>
            <p>This passion led me to choose an engineering school specialized in space and aeronautics, wich gave me all the tool I would need.
                I arrived at Toulouse in France wich is the capital of the aerospace sector. I discovered new things wich I loved such as applied mathematics and physics simulation.
                I learnt in consequences python and C++ to begin with, and I did multiple projects where I applied my courses with python.

            <p>I applied to get my option "Space Launcher and Satellite" and I got courses in space mechanics and advanced propulsion.
                I try to combine both the knowledge and skills with code and now I am frequently working on my free time on interesting projects. 
                I now am trying to learn and use new way of doing what I like with new methods like web developpement, gthub, Linux and many more...
